## Hi there 👋

My name is Valerie! I am currently a first generation college student majoring in computer science. I enjoy embedded systems, web development, and anything design (computer animation, computer graphics). I'm also currently looking into cybersecurity.

## 👩‍💻 Career Goals & Aspirations

My goal with computer science is to one day work with companies like <b>Pixar, Dreamworks, Lucasfilm, or Walt Disney</b>. I love the idea of being able to combine tech and film! I grew up watching TV and movies all the time as well as playing video games, so working in the film industry would be a dream come true. 

I also have taken an interest in web development and design, so I'd love to combine these passions and delve into the marketing, graphic design, and tech world.

I grew up believing the fallacy that movies and games were just for fun and that there was no way that I could make a career out of it. During my 1st year of college, I attended a Pixar seminar where I learned that software developers had a place in the film space. This was when my childhood hobbies and current major merged to create my ultimate career goal.

## 🐢 Who Am I Outside of Tech?

Outside of tech, I enjoy:
- Going to the gym 💪
- Playing sports (volleyball & basketball) 🏐🏀
- Reading (fiction, fantasy, young adult, self help, etc.) 📚
- Playing video games 🎮
- Hanging out with friends and family 😆
- Content creation 🎥
- Psychology (especially child development & true crime) 🧠

I'm pretty much down for anything as long as I get to spend time with loved ones!
